# mlrCPO Internals

The following describes the internal design of `mlrCPO`. Package names, file names, and object names are in monospace: `Classname`; functions are monospace with parentheses: `fun()`; exported functions are followed by an asterisk: `exportedFun()*`; list slots are monospace, prepended with a dollar sign: `$slot`.

## Overview

`mlrCPO` builds on the `mlr` package and adds flexible preprocessing operator objects. Please make sure you are familiar with the user interface, by reading the vignette, the R help pages, and possibly going through the tutorial.

## Coding Style

To fit in with the rest of *mlr-org*, it follows the same [code style guide](https://github.com/rdatsci/PackagesInfo/wiki/R-Style-Guide). A subset of this style is checked by [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) automatically during tests. To run lintr during tests, the [github version](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) needs to be installed. Use the `quicklint` tool in the `tools` directory to run lint on only the files that have changed with respect to the `master` branch.

## Class Structure

The central object of `mlrCPO` is the `CPO` with the following lifecycle and subclasses:

```
CPOConstructor ---------------> CPO ---------------> CPOTrained
                               /   \                    /   \
                              /     \                  /     \
                    CPOPrimitive   CPOPipeline  CPORetrafo  CPOInverter
```

The `CPOConstructor` is a function that is called to create a `CPO`, examples are `cpoPca` and `cpoScale`. `CPO` is the object representing a specific operation, completely with hyperparameters. `CPOTrained` represents the "retafo" operation that can be retrieved with `retrafo()*` or `inverter()*` from a preprocessed data object, or from a trained model.

```
CPO ---------------> CPOLearner ---------------> CPOModel
```

When a `CPO` gets attached to an `mlr` `Learner`, a `CPOLearner` object is created. The trained model of this learner has the class `CPOModel`.

### `CPOConstructor`

`CPOConstructor` is created in `makeCPOGeneral()` which is called by `makeCPO()*` or `makeCPOExtended()*`, or similar functions, all defined in `makeCPO.R`. A `CPOConstructor` is an R *function* that takes all the `CPO`'s arguments, as well as the `affect.*`, `export`, and `id` special arguments and assembles a `CPO` object. The body of each `CPOConstructor` is the same and can be found in `makeCPO.R`, starting at
```R
funbody = quote({
```

### `CPO`

A `CPO` can either be "primitive" or "compound".

The primitive `CPO` has the additional class `CPOPrimitive` and is at the heart of `mlrCPO` functionality. It is defined and documented in `makeCPO.R` starting at
```R
cpo = makeS3Obj(c("CPOPrimitive", "CPO"),
```
Besides much meta-information, the primitive `CPO` stores the parameter set as `$par.set` and `$unexported.par.set`, as well as the parameter values as `$par.vals` and `$unexported.pars`. The trafo and retrafo operations are functions stored in the `$trafo` and `$retrafo` slots.

A compound `CPO` can be created from two `CPO`s by composing them using the `%>>%` operator, which calls `composeCPO()*` (which can also be called directly). It has the additional class `CPOPipeline`, and is defined in `composeCPO()*`. Compound `CPO`s have a tree structure: Each compound `CPO` has a slot `$first` and `$second`, referencing two child `CPO`s (which may be compound *or* primitive) in the order in which they are applied. Otherwise `CPOPipeline` objects are relatively lightweight, they store meta-information computed from the child objects (e.g. a name referencing both children, and common properties), and parameter values.

When the hyperparameter of a `CPOPipeline` are changed, the child nodes are not modified; instead, the changed parameter values are stored in the root node. The parameter values of the child nodes are only updated when the `CPO` is actually called.

### `CPOTrained`

`CPOTrained` objects are created in `makeCPOTainedBasic`, which is called by `makeCPORetrafo` and `makeCPOInverter`, which are both called by `callCPO.CPOPrimitive`. `CPOTrained` objects are thus created whenever data is fed into a `CPO`, be it by using `%>>%`, by calling `applyCPO()*` directly, or by training a `CPOLearner`. A `CPOTrained` object is relatively lean; it mostly points to the `CPOPrimitive` object that helped create it, contains a `$state` slot which contains the control object or retrafo function created by the `$trafo` call, and "shapeinfo" about the data shape (feature names and types) used when calling the trafo.

A `CPOTrained` can be a "retrafo", an "inverter", or both. A retrafo has the `CPORetrafo` class and is used to re-apply a transformation that was "trained" on a dataset. An inverter has the `CPOInverter` class, it concerns only "Target Operating `CPO`s". It is created whenever a target operating `CPO` is applied to a dataset and gives the user the possibility of inverting the prediction performed with the transformed dataset. If the target operating `CPO` is "stateless", the resulting inverter can be used on *any* prediction, if it is not "stateless", the inverter can only be used on predictions made with the resulting transformed dataset. Since the inverters resulting from "stateless" target operating transformations can be used on any new data, they are retrieved with the `retrafo()*` call, they are so called "hybrids" (i.e. both retrafo and inverter). The `CPOInverter` specific to the prediction of an individual processed dataset is retrieved using `inverter()*`.

`CPOTrained` objects are linked lists, linked by the `$prev.retrafo` slot. The `callCPO()` call generates both `CPORetrafo` and `CPOInverter` linked lists; they are stored as attributes of the resulting data by `applyCPO.CPO()*`. `retrafio()*` and `inverter()*` are both relatively dumb functions which retrieve these object attributes.

### `CPOLearner`

The `CPOLeaner` is created using `mlr`'s `makeBaseWrapper()*` functionality, in `attachCPO()*`. Whenever another `CPO` is attached to a `CPOLearner`, the Learner is not wrapped again, instead the attached `CPO` is extended. The `CPOLearner` also has properties and hyperparameters that are extended / modified according to the `CPO`. Whenever the hyperparameters of a `CPOLearner` are changed, the attached `CPO` (and its `$par.vals` slot) is not modified; instead, the `CPO` is modified upon invocation of `trainLearner.CPOLearner()*`.

When the `train()` method is called with a `CPOLearner`, the resulting model has two `CPOTrained` attached: the `CPORetrafo` and the `CPOInverter` chains. These are used on newly arriving data, and on the resulting prediction, respectively.

### `NULLCPO`

The `NULLCPO` object has a special place in `mlrCPO`: It is the neutral element of the `%>>%` operator and stands for an "empty" cpo. All functions pertaining to it are in `NULLCPO.R`.

## File Overview

As of writing of this document, there are 21 `.R` files in the `R` directory that make up the `mlrCPO` package. They are listed here, in approximate order of dependence, and with a short description. The most important files are described in more detail in [Functionality](#functionality).

## Functionality

### `CPO` Creation (`makeCPO.R`)

`CPO` creation happens in `makeCPO.R`. Actual creation happens in `makeCPOGeneral()`, which gets called with different values depending on which `makeCPOXXX()*` is called by the user. Besides general checking of parameter validity, the `$trafo` and `$retrafo` functions are created. If they are given as special NSE blocks (just curly braces without function headers), `makeFunction` creates the necessary function headers, otherwise the given headers are checked.

The `.dataformat` and `.dataformat.factor.with.ordered` variables are internally put together into one `$datasplit` slot of `CPO`. For this, the `"split"` value of `.dataformat` is translated to either `"most"` (`.dataformat.factor.with.ordered == TRUE`) or `"all"`, and the `"factor"` value is translated to `"onlyfactor"` if `.dataformat.factor.with.ordered` is `FALSE`.

All `.trafo.type`s are handled as one would expect, with the exception of the `"trafo.returns.control"` trafo type. It is emulated by wrapping the user provided functions into a `"trafo.returns.data"` conforming stub.

### `CPO` Invocation (`callCPO.R`)

Invocation of `CPO` happens recursively by the `callCPO()` function: If called with a `CPOPipeline`, the given data is first transformed by the `$first`, then by the `$second` slot (which in turn may be `CPOPipeline` objects). If called with a `CPOPrimitive`, the necessary data and property checks (See [Format Check](#format-check-formatcheckr)) are performed and the `$trafo` slot is called, and the `CPORetrafo` and `CPOInverter` chains are constructed. Both of them are linked lists; therefore, `callCPO()` takes a `prev.retrafo` and a `prev.inverter` argument, to which the newly created retrafo and inverter objects are prepended.

Invocation of a `CPOTrained` happens in `callCPOTrained()`. It respects the linked-list nature of `CPOTrained` and recursively invocates possible `$prev.inverter` objects associated with the `CPOTrained`. For target operating `CPO`s, it goes on to call `callCPO()`, otherwise it works similarly to `callCPO()`, except calling the `$retrafo` slot of the associated `CPOPrimitive`, and only constructing a `CPOInverter` chain.

### Format Check (`FormatCheck.R`)

`FormatCheck.R` is a central part of `CPO` that does checking of input and output data for property adherence, checking that input data to retrafo conforms to input data to the corresponding trafo invocation, and conversion of data depending on `.dataformat` values for a given CPO.

Data preparation and post-processing is done by the functions `prepareTrafoInput()`, `prepareRetrafoInput()`, `handleTrafoOutput()`, and `handleRetrafoOutput()`. Each of these takes the data, desired properties, and possibly shape-info (data feature column type info), checks the data validity, and returns the converted data according to the `.dataformat`.

`FormatCheck.R` also hosts the important `compositeProperties()` function which calculates the properties of a compound `CPO` given the properties of its constituents, after checking if these properties are compatible at all.

### CPO Operators (`CPO_operators.R`)

`CPO` and `CPOTrained` composition and splitting mostly happens as they should happen for functional data structures (trees and linked lists, respectively). Composition also checks properties and computes certain aggregate metavalues (e.g. of properties or parameter values) that are stored at the root of the tree or first element of the linked list, respectively.

`CPO` getters and setters are mostly dumb accessors, with the exception of `setCPOId()*`, which actually changes the `$par.set` and `$par.vals` slots to respect the name changes of the parameters.

### `CPO` Learner Attachment (`CPOLearner.R`)

`CPOLearner`s are created using the `makeBaseWrapper()` `mlr` functionality. To prevent deep nesting of learners, if a `CPO` is attached to a `CPOLearner`, the `Learner` is *not* wrapped another time, instead the already attached `CPO` is extended by the new `CPO`. A tricky part of extending a `Learner` with a `CPO` is the calculation of resulting learner properties, which is performed by `compositeCPOLearnerProps()`. The predict type of a `CPOLearner` respects the `$predict.type` slot of the attached `CPO`(s); this translation is done by `setPredictType.CPOLearner()`.

Training of learners done using the `makeChainModel()` `mlr` function, which contains the child learner's model and also has the `CPORetrafo` created by application of the `CPO`. Prediction then only needs to apply this retrafo to the new data, run the model, and apply the inverter created by application of the retrafo.


### Retrafo State (`RetrafoState.R`)

The "retrafo state" is mostly the `$state` slot of the `CPORetrafo` object, with additional information about the data in the `$shapeinfo.input` and `$shapeinfo.output` slots. For functional `CPO`s, the retrafo function's environment is turned into a list (with the `$cpo.retrafo` pointing to that function), for object based `CPO`s, the `$state` object is saved to the retrafo state's `$control` slot, next to the hyperparameter values. `makeRetrafoFromState()*` creates a bare `CPO` object from the given constructor and puts in the state information.

### Inverter functionality (`inverter.R`)

`invert()*`'s main task is to call `invertCPO()` which calls the `$retrafo` slot of a `CPO`, but a major challenge is to convert between prediction formats. Predictions not always carry meta-information about the task type they were generated for, and they are not always in a uniform format (varying between being a vector, a matrix, a data.frame, etc.). Some helper functions take over the tasks of prediction format validation and normalization.

### The `%>>%`-Operator (`doublecaret.R`)

The `%>>%` operator is syntactic sugar for the `applyCPO`, `composeCPO`, and `attachCPO` functions defined in `callCPO.R`, `CPO_operators.R`, and `attachCPO.R`.

### `retrafo()*` and `inverter()*` (`attributes.R`)

Both `retrafo()*` and `inverter()*` are very lightweight functions that only access the respective attributes of a data object. If the data object has no such attribute, a `NULLCPO` is returned, instead of `NULL`, so that `y %>>% retrafo(x)` works even when no retrafo is present. An exception is made for `CPOModel`: It retrieves the `CPORetrafo` generated while training a `CPOLearner`; the generic is found in `CPOLearner.R`.

### NULLCPO (`NULLCPO.R`)

The `NULLCPO` object is implemented by implementing all generics for it, and have them do the respective no-op.

### `CPO` listing (`listCPO.R`)

A `CPO` is registered in a global variable `CPOLIST` by calling `registerCPO` with the respective descriptive items. To have definition and documentation relatively close, `registerCPO` should be called right after the definition of an internal `CPO`. The `listCPO` function then only creates a `data.frame` from this list.
