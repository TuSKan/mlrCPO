\title{Filter \dQuote{kruskal.test} applies a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test of the
null hypothesis that the location parameters of the distribution of a feature
are the same in each class and considers the test statistic as an variable
importance measure: if the location parameters do not differ in at least one
case, i.e., the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, there is little evidence
that the corresponding feature is suitable for classification.}
