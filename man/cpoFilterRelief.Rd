\title{Filter \dQuote{relief} is based on the feature selection algorithm \dQuote{ReliefF}
by Kononenko et al., which is a generalization of the orignal \dQuote{Relief}
algorithm originally proposed by Kira and Rendell. Feature weights are initialized
with zeros. Then for each instance \code{sample.size} instances are sampled,
\code{neighbours.count} nearest-hit and nearest-miss neighbours are computed
and the weight vector for each feature is updated based on these values.}
\usage{
cpoFilterRelief(perc = NULL, abs = NULL, threshold = NULL, id = NULL,
  affect.type = NULL, affect.index = integer(0),
  affect.names = character(0), affect.pattern = NULL,
  affect.invert = FALSE, affect.pattern.ignore.case = FALSE,
  affect.pattern.perl = FALSE, affect.pattern.fixed = FALSE)
