\title{The chi-square test is a statistical test of independence to determine whether
two variables are independent. Filter \dQuote{chi.squared} applies this
test in the following way. For each feature the chi-square test statistic is
computed checking if there is a dependency between the feature and the target
variable. Low values of the test statistic indicate a poor relationship. High
values, i.e., high dependency identifies a feature as more important.}
