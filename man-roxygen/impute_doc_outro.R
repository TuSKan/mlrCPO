#' @param impute.new.levels [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   If new, unencountered factor level occur during reimputation,
#'   should these be handled as NAs and then be imputed the same way?
#'   Default is \code{TRUE}.
#' @param recode.factor.levels [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Recode factor levels after reimputation, so they match the respective element of
#'   \code{lvls} (in the description object) and therefore match the levels of the
#'   feature factor in the training data after imputation?.
#'   Default is \code{TRUE}.
#' @family imputation CPOs
